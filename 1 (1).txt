WARMUP:

1. Create a folder called JsObjectWarmup, connect to Git/GitHub
2. Create an index.html & app.js file. Link them together
3. Configure your debugger
4. Create a variable called my_city (object) with the following key-value pairs:
  4.1. name (string)
  4.2. population (number)
  4.3. is_capital (boolean)
5. Write a conditional that will print out the city name and population if is_capital is true
6. Add an else statement that will print out `not important enough` otherwise
7. Add in a new key-value pair to my_city:
  7.1. communities (array of strings)
8. Use push to add 5 communities into the array
9. Write a while loop that will print out each community one by one
10. Modify the communities key-value pair to now be an array of objects, where each object has the following key-value pairs:
  10.1. name (string)
  10.2 population (number)
11. Modify the while loop to now only print out a community name IF the community has a population of at least 100
